### Bringing Abstraction to Life

Lisps are beautiful but syntactically-intimidating, leading many to dismiss them. This is a shame for a number of reasons, one being that Lisps are excellent pedagogical vehicles. Many classic textbooks in programming and artificial intelligence (SICP, PAIP, The Little Schemer, etc.) use Lisp dialects. SICP alone proves that Lisp can serve as a kind of programming Rosetta Stone, using just a few primitives to implement the major paradigms of computer science. However, these texts are inaccessible to those who find Lisp to be indecipherable and / or infuriating.

To make the language more accessible, I am trying to create a program that will allow teachers to easily animate Lisp evaluation, so students can see how the abstract syntax trees unfurl, contract, and self-modify in real time. 

My goal is to do an animated YouTube walkthrough of SICP - just one ignoramous enlightening others, but with excellent graphics. This current version is limited (with known issues laid out in src/projector/ast.clj), and more about programming principles than Clojure specifically. However, I do think that it can serve as a good MVP.

## Demo

You define functions to animate in the animation file of the directory. Right now, the interpreter can parse only single-arity functions, but within those constraints the formatting is identical.

When you run the app, a very simple REPL launches. It does the usual REPL thing.

When you call ```(animate)```, the REPL will then flicker through the evaluation of the previous line, step by step. It can automatically walk through a small subset of Clojure, which can be further extended by adding to the above mentioned animation file.

I see this used primarily as a teaching tool, where abstractions are made vivid through its depiction as an unfolding process. For instance, below we see how two different approaches to writing a factorial procedure (recursive and iterative) will consume stack space, depicted by vertical depth.

Teachers can create assignments where students must solve problems within a constrained subset of Clojure functions. Students will be able to walk through code step by step to understand how all the functions fit together. I next want to make the animations responsive to key inputs, so that students can effortlessly stop, slow, speed, and rewind the animations. This allows students to zero in on the exact point where understanding breaks down. This is a resolution conducive to deliberate practice.


## How it Works

Behind the scenes, a "probe" catches a ride on an s-expression, and gathers evaluation data as it zips around the interpreter. This allows it to create a "script" of the evaluation.

Each index corresponds to a node in the AST. One can filter, map, assoc, etc. over this script to customize the animations. You then feed the original expression, an environment, and the script into another function that will generate intermediate states of the program (or at least those covered by my currently impotent interpreter):

This list of "frames" constitute a little film reel of the animation. Each is already indexed, and can be turned into a zipper so that students can stop the animation and zoom around to various components. (This part will require I add the keypress portion discussed above.)


## Other Uses

* Perhaps these animations could be used to create particularly vivid flashcards for spaced repetition.

* I've yet to see good visualizations of refactoring, and of the "abstraction process" in general. I can envision extending the script indices so that common patterns (operations, operation types, tree structures, etc.) can be filtered for, appeneded, etc. The teacher can then take a bunch of expressions and manipulate opacity to let differences fade, making shared structure vivid. The shared structure then fades so that the differences are made salient. To me, that's the essence of structure, and of abstraction in general: what varies, and what stays but? Those define an abstraction's borders. 

  * One can envision a game-like curriculum where students try and "spot the similarities" in expressions, and the strobing provides rapid feedback about the patterns they did and did not detect.

  * This is more speculative, but perhaps ML could be used to "suggest" areas for abstraction by detecting and highlighting shared structure. Programmers can consider and apply the suggestions that make sense. The strobing allows for a visceral, succint, and precise depiction of the exact pattern that the machine wishes to convey.

* A more practical case: Whenever I start looking through a new repo on GitHub, I am confronted with a bunch of new functions defined in terms of new functions. Everything seems circular - I don't know where to start and where to go. I ulimately hope to write an interpreter that works on the AST output of clojure.tools.analyzer, so that I can download *any* Clojure library, and do a gradual stroll through the evalaution tree, step by step, seeing how how all the pieces fit together.
